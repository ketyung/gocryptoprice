# gocryptoprice

My first time programming in Go, learning and exploration of the Go lang.

While the https://github.com/ketyung/fetch_price_of_cryptos uses Rust to read a price of a crypto and store it
on mini redis 

This package is my learning on how to build a simple REST API by using Go to output the data stored on the mini redis.

Just the beginning!
